title: Learning Swarm Interaction Dynamics from Density Evolution
abstract: <b> Abstract:</b> Learning swarm interaction laws by observing its density evolution with iterative PDE-constrained optimization.
details: <b> Details:</b> Modeling the interaction function as a Green's function for appropriately defined linear operator, allows for the hydrodynamic mean-field limit partial integro-differential equations to be efficiently solved as a system of simple PDEs.
keywords: <b> Keywords:</b> Swarm Dynamics, Mean-field Games, Coordination Laws Inference.
