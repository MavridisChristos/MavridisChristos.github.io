<b> Description:</b> A novel communication-aware motion planning architecture that aims to improve the performance and robustness of the operation of an interacting team of agents communicating over a 5G wireless network.

<b> Details:</b> Multi-agent planning based on a hierarchical modeling and adaptation method that identifies and continuously updates a hybrid network digital twin model describing the properties of a 5G network and its environment.
