title: Progressive Graph Partitioning Based on Information Diffusion
abstract: <b> Abstract:</b> Adaptive graph partitioning based on the spectral information of the underlying graph Laplacian matrix approximated with a decentralized diffusion algorithm.
details: <b> Details:</b> By propagating an impulse through the graph via a diffusion equation, each node construct a local representation containing spectral information. Online Deterministic Annealing (ODA) is used online for adaptive spectral clustering. The approach is suitable for large graphs, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and provides online control over the complexity-accuracy trade-off.
