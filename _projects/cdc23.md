title: Online Switched System Identification
abstract: <b> Abstract:</b> Online identification scheme for discrete-time piece-wise affine models based on a system of adaptive algorithms running in two timescales.
details: <b> Details:</b> A stochastic approximation algorithm based on online deterministic annealing estimates the partition of the space that defines the switching signal, as well as the number of modes. At the same time, recursive identification running at a higher timescale updates the parameters of the local models.
keywords: <b> Keywords:</b> Switched System Identification, Piecewise-Affine Systems, Online Deterministic Annealing.
