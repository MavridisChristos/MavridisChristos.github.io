title: CPS Security in Dynamic Games under Cognitive Hierarchy
abstract: <b> Description:</b> Identification of the profiles and capabilities of attackers injecting adversarial inputs to a cyber-physical system. 
details: <b> Details:</b> Principles of behavioral game theory – specifically the concept of level-k thinking – is employed to construct a database of potential attack vectors. By observing the state trajectories under sequential interactions with different adversaries, the defender adaptively estimates both the number and the profiles of the different attack signals using an online deterministic annealing approach.
